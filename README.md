Welcome to my isometric interpretation of the hit game(even though it's not out) Hollow Knight: Silksong.
All music and Hollow Knight: Silksong characters belong to Team Cherry.

Thank you to Kabinet0 for helping me understand isometric rendering (and making me add the character)

Hornet currently moves relative to the screen, though this can be changed so that the character moves relative to the world around her.

Currently there are only 6 actions:
Move Up: Up Arrow
Move Down: Down Arrow
Move Left: Left Arrow
Move Right: Right Arrow
Jump: Z
Attack: X
